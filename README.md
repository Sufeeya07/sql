# Structured Query Language
SQL is a key language used to manage and analyze data in databases. 
It helps users easily retrieve, filter, and summarize data from one or more tables. SQL is commonly used in areas like business analysis, data science, and app development.

## This repository includes examples and practice exercises covering SQL fundamentals, such as:
* Basic queries and data retrieval
* Data filtering and sorting
* Aggregations and grouping
* Joining tables for relational analysis
* Advanced functions for data manipulation
  
## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to upload full SQL projects that will showcase real-world data analysis and problem-solving skills, applying SQL to derive insights and answer business questions.
